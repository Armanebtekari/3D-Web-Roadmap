# The Roadmap :closed_book:
This is the ultimate path for your web development transformation, which helps you with finding your way through 3D web development, gathering the tools and resources needed to master.
The roadmap includes the 9 top library which is used for todays 3D web development, with resources, code snippets and commonly asked questions inside it.
There also specific materials for your journey including the objects section, arming you with objects you can practice on.
# The Lessons :microscope:
Each lesson covers one subject, and it's better to follow them in order, but if you already feel comfortable with the basics, you can try to jump directly to more advanced techniques like the shaders.
Each lesson in the roadmap will provide you with a starter code for the first one.
You will also find it helpful to fork this repo, so you can edit it on your own github profile. 
Each lesson is based on basic expandable code, but remember, you also have access to a text version on the same page. The formated code involves syntax coloration, and every step of the way, you also have access to previews of the result you're supposed to achieve.

# The Code :balloon:
Each developer has their way to code and I have mine. During the lesson, in the starter code file the code will follow my preferences, but do as you wish. If you want to refactor all the code, go ahead.

# Prerequisite :barber:
This course is beginner-friendly, yet you need to know JavaScript basics like variables, loops, function, events, and, perhaps, modules. Don't worry about this last point; you'll figure out the module basics by following the next lessons.
Another requirement is a modern browser with useful developer tools. I'll be using Chrome, but you can also use Firefox. I don't recommend other browsers because we need our tools to be robust and efficient. At some point, we will install a Chrome extension to help us monitor WebGL performances, but this part is optional.
Finally, if you know nothing about Three.js, you're in the right place.

# Contribution :round_pushpin:
Have a look at **[contirbutions](https://github.com/Chamepp/3D-Web-Roadmap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** docs and **[discussions](https://github.com/Chamepp/3D-Web-Roadmap/discussions)** for how to update roadmaps.
Then select what you want to work on in [issues](https://github.com/Chamepp/3D-Web-Roadmap/issues) section and [improvements](https://wirehaired-faucet-769.notion.site/a435b3723c2a482abef3856d5bc53901?v=76d6978b3f89410f853b7e6c8ec504b7) list for bugs and updates.
